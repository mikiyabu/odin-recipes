# odin-recipes

This will be my first Odin Project project. That's a bit wordy haha. I will reflect after I'm done with the project to review what I need to work on more, what I excelled at and how fluent I felt writing the code. :)

I felt really good writing the code. I had an issue with the images showing up and the problem was that I wasn't doing ./recipes/lasagna.jpg/ and I was doing ./lasagna.jpg. This is wrong because the file belongs to another folder, not the same as index.html so I had to cd into the recipes folder then access the lasagna.jpg image.
